## Active Attack Simulations

### 1. Brute Force Attacks
We simulate brute force login attempts because it's crucial to verify the effectiveness of our account lockout policy. This ensures that accounts are properly locked after the specified number of failed attempts, protecting against unauthorized access.

### 2. Session Hijacking and Fixation
- **Session Hijacking:** We attempt to use stolen session cookies for unauthorized access to verify that HTTPS and secure cookie attributes effectively prevent these attacks.
- **Session Fixation:** We try to assign a known session ID to a user's session for unauthorized access, checking if the application correctly generates a new session ID upon login.

### 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
We perform MitM attacks to intercept and manipulate data in transit. This tests the enforcement of HTTPS and the effectiveness of our Content Security Policy (CSP) in preventing content from being loaded from unauthorized sources.

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
We inject malicious scripts into input fields or URL parameters to test the application's response to such inputs. This ensures our CSP effectively blocks the execution of unauthorized scripts and that input validation/sanitization is in place.

### 5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
We simulate CSRF attacks, where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. This verifies that anti-CSRF tokens or other mitigations effectively protect against these attacks.

### 6. SQL Injection and Code Injection
We attempt to inject SQL commands or malicious code into input fields. This tests if the application properly sanitizes user inputs, preventing unauthorized database access or code execution.

### 7. 2-Factor Authentication Bypass
We explore methods to bypass 2FA, such as phishing for 2FA codes or exploiting backup systems for 2FA, to assess the robustness of our authentication process.

### 8. API Abuse
We test for API endpoint vulnerabilities by attempting to access or manipulate endpoints beyond rate limits, with expired tokens, or without proper authentication. This ensures API security measures are effective.

### 9. Directory Traversal and Resource Enumeration
We attempt to access restricted directories or files through path manipulation. This tests for proper access controls and input validation to prevent unauthorized access to file systems.

### 10. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
We try to access or manipulate other users' data by modifying the URL, input fields, or API requests. This checks for proper authorization checks before accessing or modifying data.

### Conducting Active Attack Simulations
- We use penetration testing tools like **Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Metasploit** to automate and manage some of these attack simulations.
- **Ethical considerations:** It's crucial to always have explicit permission to perform these tests on live systems, preferably conducting these tests in a staging environment.
- **Legal compliance:** We ensure that our testing complies with all relevant laws and regulations to avoid legal repercussions.
