# Session Hijacking and Fixation

1. Session Hijacking: Attempt to use stolen session cookies to gain unauthorized access, verifying that HTTPS and secure cookie attributes are correctly preventing these attacks.

2. Session Fixation: Try to assign a known session ID to a user's session and use it for unauthorized access, checking if the application correctly generates a new session ID at login.
